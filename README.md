# My Little Hero
## Idea
<p>
     The My Little Hero app is created to help parents spend time with kids reading about their favorite characters. Another goal is helping youth kids reading on their own.
The trial version will present a one-page app with simple functionalities of chosen parameters and getting an immediate result. The version's goal is to present an idea of the application and get feedback from the focus groups.
